Here is some text here introducing the SCI-WMS server for netcdf 
and opendap met-ocean data. SCI-WMS is a Python WMS service for geospatial 
gridded data. It supports triangular unstructured meshes and logically 
rectangular grids.

If you would like to know if your dataset can be served with SCI-WMS, 
or how to get started with your own SCI-WMS server we would be happy 
to help.
