Roadmap
=======

SCI-WMS is funded by a number of organizations to fufill the specific 
needs of the Metorological and Oceanographic community. We are 
committed to ensuring that the project follows a logical and innovative 
path, but due to time and budget constraints some enhancements and 
updates will take precedence over others.

We welcome discussion of problems and suggestions for new features at 
the `SCI-WMS Google Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/sci-wms>`_. 
Enhancements that have been accepted by the team for inclusion into the project can 
be found at the project Github `repository <http://github.com/acrosby/sci-wms/issues?state=open>`_.

The target for Version 1.0.0 is a server that is

* Well documented
* Easy to install
* Easy to administer
* Stable
